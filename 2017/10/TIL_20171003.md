## JavaScript
+ 함수형 프로그래밍 개념 정리
+ 블로그에 포스트

I studied Functional Programming with JavaScript today.
Functional Programming is NOT easy to learn but it is useful to programming.
Because it makes developer types less code than not use I think.
So I need to practice using this powerful skill.
Anyway today is the first day of Thanks Giving Day in Korea.
So I'm gonna enjoy the foods and something special for holidays.
